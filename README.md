Some of my console scripts

#Create-count-of-Folder
This creates folders with a definable amount.

#ping Standardgateway
This pings your Gateway(maybe Router)

#Reload Dir
This syncs 2 directorys

#echo text with number
This creates text with a number. Just a help if you want counted sentences.

#Doc with date
This copy a doc from yesterday and rename it. You can use it for protocols. Easy to change if you want a daily doc based on a formular.
